## User Feedbacks

- [ ] Make the bricks a littls bigger or reduce the number.
- [ ] Leave some side space to allow ball to cruise through to earn points.
- [ ] Reduce the speed of the ball.

  - Doing this, might reduce the efficiency of our game from my (*Raymond*) perspective. Considering the long trajectory that our ball has to travel.

## Personal Reviews

### 1. Raymond's Reviews on Improvements

- [ ] Make the game components be dynamic
- [ ] The ball can hit more than one brick at a single bounce unrealistically, the Math is off.
